## Introduction

This document serves as my personal journal for improving how I write Python. Its primary purpose is self-improvement‚Äîa way to systematically explore and document my experiences and learnings. The goal is to refine my coding practices in Python by establishing clear, consistent, and effective guidelines for myself.

This is not a declaration of a "perfect" or "best" way to code. Instead, it represents my best effort to become a more proficient programmer. I will use this space to explore project setup, tooling, static typing, testing strategies, and a programming style that leans towards functional paradigms, while also respecting the idiomatic practices of the Python community.

## Project Structure & Setup

A robust and reproducible project setup is the foundation of any serious software endeavor. This section documents a modern, high-performance toolkit designed to ensure code quality, consistency, and developer productivity.

### Core Tooling

Our setup standardizes on a few key tools to handle the most critical aspects of the development lifecycle: dependency management, formatting, linting, and type checking.

- **Package and Environment Manager: `uv`** üì¶
  We use **`uv`** as our primary tool for managing Python packages and virtual environments. Developed by Astral (the creators of `ruff`), `uv` is an extremely fast, all-in-one project and package manager written in Rust. It replaces the need for separate tools like `pip`, `venv`, `pip-tools`, and in many cases, `conda`. Its speed and modern feature set make it an ideal choice for new projects.

  - **Official Link**: [uv Documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

- **Linter and Formatter: `ruff`** üé®
  For code linting and formatting, we rely exclusively on **`ruff`**. It is an incredibly fast linter and formatter that can replace a multitude of older tools like Black, isort, Flake8, and Pyupgrade. By combining these functions into a single, cohesive tool, `ruff` simplifies configuration and dramatically speeds up CI/CD pipelines and local development workflows.

- **Static Type Checker: `mypy`** üîç
  To enforce type safety and catch potential bugs before runtime, we use **`mypy`**. By adding static type hints to our code and running `mypy` to check them, we create more robust, self-documenting, and maintainable software. While `pyright` is another excellent option, our current setup is standardized on `mypy`.

### Automation and Workflow

To ensure these tools are used consistently, we automate our workflow using `pre-commit` for quality gates and `invoke` for task management.

- **Automated Quality Gates: `pre-commit`**
  We use the `pre-commit` framework to run our quality checks automatically before any code is committed. This prevents common errors from ever entering the codebase. Our `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is configured to:

  - Format and lint all Python code with **`ruff`**.
  - Run static type analysis with **`mypy`**.
  - Check for large files, merge conflicts, and YAML syntax errors.
  - Fix trailing whitespace and file endings.
  - Clear output from Jupyter Notebooks to keep version control clean.
  - Check for spelling errors with `codespell`.
  - Validate the `pyproject.toml` file structure.

- **Task Automation: `invoke`**
  The `tasks.py` file, powered by **`invoke`**, serves as our command-line interface for common development tasks. It provides simple, memorable commands to abstract away complex underlying logic. The current implementation automates:
  - **Environment Setup**: A `prepare` task that detects or installs a Python distribution (currently via Miniforge/Conda) and sets up the project environment.
  - **Running Checks**: Tasks to manually trigger `mypy`, `pytest`, and `pre-commit`.
  - **Development Services**: Commands to easily start JupyterLab and the MLflow tracking server with the correct configurations.
  - **Running Applications**: Shortcuts for launching training scripts and experiments.

### Future Directions: Templates and Monorepos

This setup is a great starting point, and we plan to evolve it.

- **Project Templates**
  A valuable next step is to create standardized project templates. We could have different templates for various use cases, such as:

  - `script`: A minimal template for a standalone Python script.
  - `app`: A more complex template for a web application or service, including boilerplate for APIs and Docker.
  - `ml-project`: A template for a machine learning project with predefined directories for data, notebooks, and models.

- **Monorepo Architecture with `uv`**
  While the current `tasks.py` leverages `conda`, the long-term vision is to fully embrace `uv` for both standalone projects and complex monorepos.

  - **Is `uv` good for monorepos?** Yes. `uv` is an excellent choice for monorepos. It respects Python's packaging standards and integrates perfectly with `pyproject.toml` [workspaces](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/), allowing you to manage multiple local, interdependent packages seamlessly.
  - **Replacing Conda**: We can replace the Conda-based environment logic in `tasks.py` with `uv`. The workflow would look like this:
    1.  `uv venv`: Create a virtual environment.
    2.  `uv pip sync pyproject.toml`: Install all project dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` into the environment. This single command installs dependencies from all packages within the monorepo workspace.

  This approach would give us a faster, more modern, and more standards-compliant workflow that aligns perfectly with the rest of our chosen toolkit.
