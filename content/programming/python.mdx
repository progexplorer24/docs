## Introduction

This document serves as my personal journal for improving how I write Python. Its primary purpose is self-improvementâ€”a way to systematically explore and document my experiences and learnings. The goal is to refine my coding practices in Python by establishing clear, consistent, and effective guidelines for myself.

This is not a declaration of a "perfect" or "best" way to code. Instead, it represents my best effort to become a more proficient programmer. I will use this space to explore project setup, tooling, static typing, testing strategies, and a programming style that leans towards functional paradigms, while also respecting the idiomatic practices of the Python community.

## Project Structure & Setup

_This section will detail project templates, directory layouts, and dependency management using tools like Poetry._

## Tooling for Code Quality

_This section will cover linters and formatters like Ruff, static type checkers like mypy, and automation with pre-commit hooks._

## Testing Environment

_This section will outline the setup and best practices for testing with pytest._

## Programming Guidelines

_This is where I will explore my core philosophy, focusing on immutability, expression-oriented programming, and a functional approach, while comparing it with idiomatic Python._

## Recipes and Formulas

_This section will act as a personal cookbook of useful code snippets and patterns._

## Bibliography

_A collection of articles, books, and resources that have informed this guide._
