## Introduction

This document serves as my personal journal for improving how I write Rust. Its primary purpose is self-improvementâ€”a way to systematically explore and document my experiences and learnings. The goal is to refine my coding practices in Rust by mastering its core principles and applying them effectively.

This is not a declaration of a "perfect" or "best" way to code. Instead, it represents my best effort to become a more proficient programmer. I will use this space to explore project setup, the rich tooling ecosystem, testing strategies, and what it means to write safe, concurrent, and idiomatic Rust code.

## Project Structure & Setup

_This section will detail project templates using Cargo, workspace organization, and dependency management._

## Tooling for Code Quality

_This section will cover the essential tools provided by the Rust ecosystem, including rustfmt and clippy._

## Testing Environment

_This section will outline the setup and best practices for using Rust's built-in testing framework._

## Programming Guidelines

_This is where I will explore Rust's core philosophy, focusing on ownership, borrowing, safety, and zero-cost abstractions, documenting my journey to write truly idiomatic Rust._

## Recipes and Formulas

_This section will act as a personal cookbook of useful code snippets and patterns._

## Bibliography

_A collection of articles, books, and resources that have informed this guide._
