## Introduction

This document serves as my personal journal for improving how I write TypeScript. Its primary purpose is self-improvementâ€”a way to systematically explore and document my experiences and learnings. The goal is to refine my coding practices in TypeScript by establishing clear, consistent, and effective guidelines for myself.

This is not a declaration of a "perfect" or "best" way to code. Instead, it represents my best effort to become a more proficient programmer. I will use this space to explore project setup, tooling, testing strategies, and a programming style that leans towards functional paradigms, while also respecting the idiomatic practices of the TypeScript community.

## Project Structure & Setup

_This section will detail project templates, directory layouts, and dependency management._

## Tooling for Code Quality

_This section will cover linters, formatters, and automation tools like pre-commit hooks._

## Testing Environment

_This section will outline the setup and best practices for testing with Jest or Vitest._

## Programming Guidelines

_This is where I will explore my core philosophy, focusing on immutability, expression-oriented programming, and a functional approach, while comparing it with idiomatic TypeScript._

## Recipes and Formulas

_This section will act as a personal cookbook of useful code snippets and patterns._

## Bibliography

_A collection of articles, books, and resources that have informed this guide._
