description: An Ansible-based automation script for provisioning a full-fledged pentesting and development environment on Garuda Linux.

## Introduction

This guide details an Ansible automation script designed to provision a complete pentesting and development environment on a fresh installation of Garuda Linux. The primary goal is to create a standardized, reproducible, and efficient setup for our entire team.

### Why Standardize?

Having a consistent environment across the team offers significant advantages:

- **Seamless Collaboration**: When everyone uses the same operating system, tools, and configurations, working together becomes much easier. We can share scripts, commands, and workflows without worrying about compatibility issues.
- **Simplified Support**: If a problem arises, it's faster to troubleshoot because the environment is familiar to everyone. Team members can easily help each other out, reducing downtime.
- **Leveraging Collective Knowledge**: This setup codifies the tools and configurations vetted by our most experienced members. New or junior colleagues can get up and running quickly, benefiting from proven practices without spending hours on individual research and setup.

### The Need for Automation

In our line of work, it's standard practice to reinstall our operating systems frequently, especially after a competition, a major engagement, or simply to ensure a clean state. This frequent re-installation makes a manual setup process impractical and time-consuming. An automated script ensures that we can rebuild our entire environment quickly, reliably, and with minimal effort, allowing us to focus on our core tasks.

### An Evolving Script

We will begin with a minimal, foundational script that installs and configures the most essential tools. Over time, this Ansible playbook will be gradually extended and refined based on our collective needs, experiences, and feedback, ensuring it remains a practical and powerful asset for the team.
