# Security Monitoring with the Elastic Stack

This document contains essential, notes for using the Elastic Stack in security monitoring. The focus is on practical application for passing exams and solving challenges.

---

## 1. Elastic Stack: Core Components & Architecture

### Core Components

A quick-reference for the main parts of the stack:

* **Elasticsearch**: The brain. It stores, indexes, and searches all the data.
* **Logstash**: The pipeline. It collects data from various sources, transforms it (e.g., normalizing), and sends it to Elasticsearch.
* **Kibana**: The face. It's the web interface you use to search, visualize, and analyze data with dashboards. **This is your primary tool.**
* **Beats**: The collectors. Lightweight agents installed on servers/endpoints to ship data (e.g., logs, metrics) to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

### Data Flow Architecture

There are two common patterns for getting data into the stack:

1.  **For simple collection and forwarding:**
    `Beats -> Elasticsearch -> Kibana`

2.  **When data needs transformation or enrichment:**
    `Beats -> Logstash -> Elasticsearch -> Kibana`

## 2. KQL (Kibana Query Language) Fundamentals

KQL is how you search for data in Kibana. Master this syntax.

| Syntax               | Description                                                                  | Example                                                |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Field Search** | The core of KQL. `field:value`.                                              | `event.code:4625`                                      |
| **Free Text Search** | Searches for a value across all indexed fields.                              | `"svc-sql1"`                                           |
| **Logical AND** | Requires both conditions to be true.                                         | `event.code:4625 AND user.name:"administrator"`        |
| **Logical OR** | Requires either condition to be true.                                        | `user.name:"guest" OR user.name:"temp"`                |
| **Logical NOT** | Excludes records that match the condition.                                   | `NOT source.ip:"10.0.1.5"`                             |
| **Greater Than** | `field:>value`. Also available: `>=` (greater or equal).                     | `source.bytes > 4000`                                  |
| **Less Than** | `field:<value`. Also available: `<=` (less or equal).                         | `@timestamp < "2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z"`               |
| **Wildcard** | Use `*` to match any number of characters.                                   | `user.name:admin*` (matches admin, administrator, etc) |
| **Grouping** | Use `()` to combine expressions and control logic.                           | `(process.name:powershell.exe OR process.name:cmd.exe) AND NOT user.name:system` |

## 3. The Elastic Common Schema (ECS)

ECS is a standard naming scheme for fields. Understanding it is critical for writing effective, reusable queries.

**Actionable Rule**: When writing queries, **always prefer the ECS field** (e.g., `event.code`, `source.ip`, `user.name`) over a beat-specific field (e.g., `winlog.event_id`). ECS fields work across all data sources (Windows, Linux, Firewalls), making your queries universal.

### Common ECS & Beat Fields Reference

This table is a quick reference for fields you've encountered. Use the `.keyword` suffix when grouping/aggregating in visualizations (e.g., `user.name.keyword`).

| Category | Field Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General** | `@timestamp` | When the event was processed by the Elastic Stack. |
| | `event.created` | When the event originally occurred on the source machine. Often more accurate. |
| **Event** | `event.code` | The identifier for a specific event type (e.g., `4625`). |
| | `event.action` | The activity performed (e.g., `member-added-to-security-group`). |
| **Host** | `host.hostname` | The name of the machine where the event occurred. |
| **User** | `user.name` | The name of the user involved in the event. |
| | `group.name` | The name of the security group involved. |
| **Network** | `source.ip` | Source IP address. |
| | `source.bytes` | Size of data from the source. |
| | `destination.ip` | Destination IP address. |
| | `related.ip` | An IP address related to the event, often the source of an RDP logon. |
| **Process** | `process.name` | The name of the process (e.g., `powershell.exe`). |
| **Winlogbeat** | `winlog.logon.type` | The logon method (e.g., `RemoteInteractive` for RDP). |
| | `winlog.event_data.SubStatus` | The reason code for a failed logon. |
| | `winlog.event_data.MemberSid`| The Security Identifier (SID) of a user added/removed from a group. |

## 4. Key Security Identifiers & Fields

### Common Windows Event Codes (`event.code`)

| Event Code | Event Name | Why it's important |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4624** | An account was successfully logged on | Track successful logons, identify unusual RDP or service account usage. |
| **4625** | An account failed to log on | **Key indicator** for brute-force or password-guessing attacks. |
| **4732** | Member added to security-enabled group | Crucial for tracking **privilege escalation**. |
| **4733** | Member removed from security-enabled group | Track privilege changes. |
| **4688** | A new process has been created | Track command-line activity and malicious software execution. |

### Windows Logon Sub-Status Codes (`winlog.event_data.SubStatus`)

When an `event.code:4625` (logon failure) occurs, this code tells you **why** it failed.

| Sub-Status Code | Reason | Why it's important |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0xc000006a** | Incorrect user name or password | High volume can indicate brute-forcing. |
| **0xc0000072** | Account is disabled | An attacker may be trying to use a known but disabled account. **Highly suspicious.** |
| **0xc0000234** | Account is locked out | Indicates a brute-force attempt likely already happened. |
| **0xc0000064** | Account does not exist | Someone is guessing usernames. |

## 5. Creating Visualizations in Kibana

Dashboards are containers for your visualizations (charts, tables, etc.).

### General Workflow for a Table Visualization

1.  **Navigate & Create**: Go to **Dashboard** -> **Create new dashboard** -> **Create visualization**.
2.  **Set Scope**:
    * **Time Range**: Click the calendar icon. For initial exploration, set an absolute range or "Last 15 years" to see all data.
    * **Index Pattern**: Select the correct data source, e.g., `windows*`.
3.  **Choose Type**: Select **Table** from the visualization type dropdown.
4.  **Define Data**:
    * **Metrics (The 'What')**: This is the calculation. For counting events, click **Metrics** and select **Count**.
    * **Buckets / Rows (The 'How')**: This is how you group the data. Click **Rows** and add the fields you want to group by. **Crucially, use the `.keyword` version of a field for aggregation** (e.g., `user.name.keyword`, not `user.name`).
5.  **Filter Data**: Use the main **KQL search bar** or the **Add Filter** button to narrow your data to specific events (e.g., `event.code:4625`).
6.  **Refine & Save**:
    * You can edit row settings to add a **Custom label** (to rename a column) or change the sorting.
    * Click **Save and return** to add the visualization to the dashboard.
    * Finally, **Save** the dashboard itself.

### Practical Visualization Recipes

Use the workflow above with the following "ingredients" to create common security visualizations.

| Goal | Filters & KQL | Rows (Group By) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Failed Logons (All Users)** | `event.code:4625` <br/> KQL: `NOT user.name: *$` (to exclude computer accounts) | `user.name.keyword` <br/> `host.hostname.keyword` <br/> `winlog.logon.type.keyword` |
| **Failed Logons (Disabled Users)** | `event.code:4625` <br/> `winlog.event_data.SubStatus:"0xc0000072"` | `user.name.keyword` <br/> `host.hostname.keyword` |
| **Suspicious RDP from Service Accounts** | `event.code:4624` <br/> `winlog.logon.type:"RemoteInteractive"` <br/> KQL: `user.name:svc-*` | `user.name.keyword` <br/> `host.hostname.keyword` <br/> `related.ip` |
| **Privilege Changes (Local Admins)** | `event.code:(4732 OR 4733)` <br/> `group.name:"Administrators"` <br/> Use **Time Picker** for specific date ranges. | `event.action.keyword` <br/> `user.name.keyword` <br/> `winlog.event_data.MemberSid.keyword` <br/> `host.hostname.keyword` |


## 6. Alert Triaging & Decision Making

### The 4-Step Triaging Workflow

1.  **Review**: What does the alert literally say? Check the user, host, source/destination IPs, and the rule that triggered it.
2.  **Contextualize**: Does this make sense for our environment? Compare the alert against what you know is normal (e.g., from the senior analyst's notes). Is it a known behavior?
3.  **Assess**: How bad is this? Is it a minor policy violation or a potential compromise of a critical system?
4.  **Act**: Based on your assessment, choose your path: resolve, consult, or escalate.

### Decision Guide: When to Choose What

Use these rules of thumb to make your decision.

#### üßê When to "Consult with IT Operations"

Choose this path when an activity **violates policy but isn't an obvious attack**. You need more information to rule out a false positive or a legitimate (but non-compliant) action by the IT team.

* **Your Goal**: Ask "Did you do this?" before sounding a major alarm.
* **Example 1: Admin logon not from PAW.** The alert shows an admin logged on from a regular workstation. Your notes say this shouldn't happen, but also that "the IT operation team often tends to use the default administrator account(s) even if they are told otherwise."
    * **Action**: **Consult.** This is a known bad habit. Ask the IT team to verify their activity before escalating.
* **Example 2: User added to "Administrators" group.** This is a major privilege change. It could be a legitimate user promotion or an attacker escalating privileges.
    * **Action**: **Consult.** Ask IT Operations: "Did you intentionally add this person to the Administrators group?" If they say "No," you escalate immediately.

#### üö® When to "Escalate to a Tier 2/3 Analyst"

Choose this path for activity that is **highly suspicious, explicitly forbidden by security controls, or indicates an active compromise.** This requires immediate, deeper investigation.

* **Your Goal**: Get expert eyes on a potential incident right away.
* **Example 1: RDP logon from a service account.** Your notes say service accounts (`-svc`) should **never** be used for interactive logon. This is a direct violation of a security control and a huge red flag for credential misuse.
    * **Action**: **Escalate.** No need for consultation.
* **Example 2: Failed logon from a disabled user.** There is zero legitimate reason for a disabled account to have a logon attempt. This strongly suggests an attacker is using a list of old, known credentials.
    * **Action**: **Escalate.** This is a clear security event.
* **Example 3: SSH login as `root` on a Linux server.** Your notes say the root account is blocked from remote login. Seeing an alert for this means a critical security control has failed or been bypassed.
    * **Action**: **Escalate.** This is an immediate, high-priority incident.

#### ‚úÖ When to choose "Nothing Suspicious"

Choose this path only when you can confidently say the activity is **100% expected and aligns with all known policies and procedures.** In a real-world scenario, this is common. In a security challenge, it's rare.
* **Your Goal**: Close the alert because it represents normal, sanctioned behavior.
* **Example**: An alert shows an administrator successfully logged into a domain controller from the designated Privileged Admin Workstation (PAW) during normal business hours. This is exactly what is supposed to happen.
    * **Action**: Acknowledge and close the alert.

## 7. Kibana Caveats & Gotchas

This section documents non-obvious behaviors and common pain points that can cost you time during a challenge.

### Incorrect Dates in Tables: The Date Bucketing Pitfall

* **The Problem**: You create a table visualization to show events over time. You add the `@timestamp` column, but the date shown is clearly wrong (e.g., your table shows `2023-02-27`, but you know the event happened on `2023-03-05`).

* **The Cause**: To keep tables readable, Kibana automatically groups data into time "buckets." If the time range is wide, it might create large buckets (e.g., 7 days, 30 days). It then labels the entire row with the **start date of the bucket**, not the date of the actual event inside it. Your event on March 5th fell into a bucket that started on Feb 27th, so the table misleadingly showed Feb 27th.

* **The Solution**: You must force Kibana to use 1-day buckets.
    1.  In the visualization editor, when configuring the `@timestamp` column, ensure the aggregation is set to **Top Hit**.
    2.  Just below the field selection, a toggle for **"Customize time interval"** will appear. Enable it.
    3.  Set the **"Minimum Interval"** to **1** and select **"Day(s)"** from the dropdown.
    4.  Apply the changes. The table will now be forced to show the correct date for each event.

* **Troubleshooting**: If the fix above doesn't work, check the dashboard's main **Time Picker** (top-right of the screen). If it's set to a narrow range (like "Today"), it might be excluding the event entirely. Widen it to "Last 5 years" or an absolute range to be sure you are seeing all the data.
