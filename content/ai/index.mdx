## Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

This section is dedicated to my journey into the field of Artificial Intelligence, with an initial focus on Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a fascinating area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

Here, I will document my understanding of the fundamental principles, algorithms, and frameworks that power modern RL systems. We will explore everything from basic concepts to advanced, state-of-the-art algorithms used to solve complex problems and play games at a superhuman level.
